Copy information about your teachers from your SIS into the [following spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HhXDBVQp0gzInrwArV_7p60fFSzWk-7SMuW26Xns5lw/copy).  In the sheet, put the folder ID of the google folder containg the individual class reports (i.e. if the folder containinn your ES reports is 123xwy, and your MS reports are qwe234, then in the spreadsheet with the teacher listing would hav 123xyz for each ES teacher and qwe234 for each MS teacher).

In the script, change the variable senderName on line 8 to match your name to be used in who the email is coming from.
